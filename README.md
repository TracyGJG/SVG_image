# SVG_image
Create an SVG from a background image.

This project uses the GitHub Octocat logo that is available as an SVG file.

The image is used twice, once as an opaque background image <IMG>, and again as SVG tag. I have disabled most of the SVG tags leaving just the drop off the tail. Notice the drop is in red and offset by 10vpx in both X and Y directions.
